## PHPceptron

Simple perceptron implementation in PHP. Internal functions can "draw" 2D images (i.e. 2-dimensional arrays) containing filled rectangles (labelled 0) or filled circles (labelled with 1). The WIDTH and HEIGHT constants dictate the size of images. The perceptron has WIDTH*HEIGHT inputs, and each input is assigned a weight, each being trained individually based on which inputs contain meainingful data about shapes, and whether or not the perceptron activates when it should.
