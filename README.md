# PHPceptron

Simple perceptron implementation in PHP, which can perform binary classification between rectangles and circles.

Rectangles and circles are drawn on a WIDTHxHEIGHT grid, and may look like the following with WIDTH=HEIGHT=30:

The perceptron takes WIDTHxHEIGHT inputs, and assigns a weight to each input. If the dot product of a WIDTHxHEIGHT-dimensional vector containing all perceptron inputs and a similar vector containing the weights is greater than a pre-defined threshold (or bias), the perceptron "activates", and if the threshold is not greater, it doesn't activate. Rectangles and circles are each consistently and arbitrarily labelled 0 or 1, and the perceptron should activate (i.e. output 1) when it has as its input an image labelled 1, and should not activate (i.e. output 0) when it has as its input an image labelled 0, to correctly classify images.

The algorithm governing "training", or updating of weights, is very simple. If the perceptron doesn't activate when it should, the pixels of the image are added to the weights, and if the perceptron does activate when it shouldn't, the pixels of the image are subtracted from the weights.

With very brief experimentation, I was able to train the perceptron to a test accuracy of just over 70%. Heavily dependent on random distribution of shapes drawn.
